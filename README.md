# US Airports (July 2017)
***
### Project Introduction
This simple project maps out all the registered airports in the United States as of July 2017. In this map, I took a look at airports that have control towers and ones that do not. Furthermore, the density of airports (count of number of airports) per state is represented through the choropleth map.
